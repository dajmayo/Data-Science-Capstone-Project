# Data Science Capstone Project
## Overview
In this repository, included are the files needed in making the shiny application and a presentation on the basic information (instructions, user guide, sources, etc.) of the project. 

### Instructions
The goal is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that is built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others easily. For this project, the requirements are:

• A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
• A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching the algorithm and application as if presenting to your boss or an investor.
